##RESTful web services        
RESTful Web Services are basically **REST Architecture based Web Services**. In REST Architecture **everything is a resource**. RESTful web services are light weight, highly scalable and maintainable and are very commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications.              
              
###What is REST  
REST is short for **REpresentational State Transfer**. REST is a web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication. It revolves around resources where **every component is a resource** and a **resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods**.                   
                                                                         
In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and the REST client accesses and presents the resources(**Assumes no direct link between server and client**). Here each resource is identified by URIs/ Global IDs. **REST uses various representations to represent a resource like Text, JSON and XML**. JSON is now the most popular format being used in Web Services.                  
                            
###HTTP Methods 
The following HTTP methods are most commonly used in a REST based architecture.                     
− **GET**(Provides a **read only access** to a resource.)            
− **PUT**(Used to **create** a new resource.)          
− **DELETE**(Used to remove a resource.)        
− **POST**(Used to **update** an existing resource **or create** a new resource.)            
− **OPTIONS**(Used to get the supported operations on a resource. )                        
                   
###RESTFul Web Services  
A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer. This interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux applications) is due to the use of open standards.                                         
             
**Web services based on REST Architecture are known as RESTful Web Services**. These web services **use HTTP methods** to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which is a service that provides resource representation such as JSON and a set of HTTP Methods.
