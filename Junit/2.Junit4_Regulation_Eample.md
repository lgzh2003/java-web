##JUNIT
      
###Junit install and test
1.download junit-4.12.jar from Junit official site            
2.import this jar into the the project and build it to path(Do not use junit directly before the download, since the version may be outdated)          
3.write a test class to confirm. 
(1)create a new **source folder** which naming test.                    
(2)create a package that is the same with the package that contains the class you wanna test.      
(3)create a test class that is added prefix "Test" appending to the class you wanna test.       
(4)In Junit4, a POJO class(Plain Old Java Object which only contains properties and setter&getter method) is a test class, we use "@Test" to indicate test method, "@Before" as initiation method, and "@After" as resource release method. But in order to make it use in Junit3 as well, we are used to name the initiation method as "setUp" ,the resource release method as "tearDown" and test method with the mode "testXxx".                   
(5)How to use Assert?                       
Junit4 has provided users with **Assert** class which contains tons of methods for for assertion. But in Junit3, since we have made the test class extends to TestCase, so we can use assert directly.                
                   
###Example
1.Class Calculation            
```
package com.max.junitTest;

public class Calculation {
	public int add(int a, int b){
		return a+b;
	}
	public int minus(int a, int b){
		return a-b;
	}
	public int multi(int a, int b){
		return a*b;
	}
	public int divide(int a, int b){
		return a/b;
	}
}

```   
      
2.Class TestCalculation                
```
package com.max.junitTest;

import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestCalculation {
	
	Calculation cal = null;
	@Before
	public void setUp(){
		System.out.println("Inititate");
		cal = new Calculation();
	}
	
	@Test
	public void testAdd(){
		int value = cal.add(10, 21);
		int trueAnswer = 10+21;
		Assert.assertEquals("add method may has a bug", value, trueAnswer);
	}
	
	/////(timeout = 300) refers that the test method should wrong in 300 millis
	///It always used for Performance Testing
	@Test(timeout = 300)
	public void testMinus(){
		int value = cal.minus(10, 21);
		int trueAnswer = 10-21;
		Assert.assertEquals("minus method may has a bug", value, trueAnswer);
		//while(true){}
	}
}

```
